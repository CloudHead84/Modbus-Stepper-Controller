# Modbus-Stepper-Controller
Step/Dir Controller based on teensy. Acts as a Modbus tcp slave, so a modbus master is needed for the setup. the master will need a library issuing different commands over the modbus registers.

First Prototype for testing communication via modbus and implementing the slave firmware in arduino
